Beautifully engraved certificate from the Hertz Corporation issued in 1976-1977. This historic document was printed by the Security-Columbian Banknote Company and has an ornate border around it with a vignette of an allegorical man and woman sitting beside the company's logo. This item has the printed signatures of the company_s chairman (Robert L. Stone) and vice-president,finance and assistant secretary. This bond is over 34 years old. Hertz, the world's leading vehicle renting organization, is represented in over 140 countries, operating a fleet of 525,000 vehicles from approximately 6,500 locations. The pioneer of auto renting was Walter L. Jacobs who in September of 1918, at the age of 22, opened a car-rental operation in Chicago. Starting with a dozen Model T Fords, which he repaired and repainted himself, Jacobs expanded his operation to the point where, within five years, the business generated annual revenues of about $1 million. In 1923, Jacobs sold his car-rental concern to John Hertz, President of Yellow Cab and Yellow Truck and Coach Manufacturing Company. Jacobs continued as Hertz' top operating and administrative executive. This rental business, called Hertz Drive-Ur-Self System, was acquired in 1926 by General Motors Corporation when it bought Yellow Truck from John Hertz. The Hertz Corporation In 1953, the Hertz properties were bought from GMC by the Omnibus Corporation, which divested itself of its bus interest and concentrated solely on car and truck renting and leasing. A year later, a new name was taken -- The Hertz Corporation -- and it was listed for the first time on the New York Stock Exchange. Jacobs became Hertz' first President and served in that post until his retirement in 1960. He died in 1985 at the age of 88. In 1954, the new corporation bought Metropolitan Distributors, a pioneer in New York truck leasing dating back to World War I and the largest concern of its kind in any one city. In the process, the head of Metropolitan, Leon C. Greenbaum, became Vice Chairman of the Hertz Board of Directors; he later became Chairman, and in 1960, Chief Executive Officer. In 1967, The Hertz Corporation became a wholly owned subsidiary of RCA Corporation and operated as a separate entity, with its own management and Board of Directors. In 1985, Hertz joined UAL, Inc. On December 30, 1987, Hertz was sold to Park Ridge Corporation, a company formed by Ford Motor Company and Hertz management, for the purpose of purchasing Hertz. In 1988, Volvo North America Corporation joined Ford and Hertz management as an investor in Park Ridge Corporation. In 1993, Park Ridge Corporation was merged into The Hertz Corporation. In 1994, Ford purchased the outstanding shares of Hertz and Hertz became an independent, wholly owned subsidiary of The Ford Motor Company. On April 25, 1997, Hertz became a publicly traded company, listed on the New York Stock Exchange, under the symbol \"HRZ.\" Hertz Today Hertz is headquartered in Park Ridge, New Jersey. Its current headquarters location opened in 1988. Prior to that the corporation was based in New York and, before that, Chicago. Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, is the site of Hertz' Worldwide Reservations Center and Data Center, established in 1970, and its Financial Center, established in 1994. Car rentals, the largest and best known of Hertz' activities, are conducted from more than 1,600 domestic, corporate and licensee locations, and approximately 4,500 corporate and licensee locations outside the United States. Hertz offers a wide variety of current-model cars on a short-term rental basis -- daily, weekly or monthly -- at airports, in downtown and suburban business centers, and in residential areas and resort locales. Today, Hertz' Worldwide Reservations System handles approximately 40 million phone calls and delivers in total approximately 30 million reservations annually This Authentic certificate looks great framed and is much nicer in person than the scan indicates.

One is a ballerina with a pink and red dress. Another is a bartender with a big mustache mixing a drink.

And the last two are the same of a dancer with a top hat sitting on a stool with a drink in his hand. These appear to be for a bar. I'm not sure how the ballerina fits into the picture. There is one other coaster that came with the set that is being listed seperately. It is a black man playing a saxaphone. If you are interested in it be sure to look at my auction. But note it will end a day earlier than this group. Also there is a coaster with no character that I will throw in if the winning bidder wants it. They need to let me know. These coasters are really, really cute. They are in great shape with no chips or cracks. The colors are very bright and nothing missing. There are some brown spots here and there, but you have to have them in good light to see the spots. I really believe the winning bidder is going to love them! There is no reserve.

Has pinup/poster back page. Buyer pays $1.95 for First Class shipping and handling to any destination in the USA and I will always combine multiple wins to get the best possible shipping rate. Insured shipping is optional but reasonable (starts at under a dollar and goes up depending on the value of the item, fragility of the item, etc.) I accept just about any kind of payment: All major credit cards are accepted directly and without fees: Visa, MasterCard, Discover and American Express. I also accept Money Orders, Personal Checks, Business Checks, Cashier Checks and even straight Wampum. And of course, I honor basically all the payment services: Billpoint, PayPal, BidPay and PayDirect, with PayPal being perhaps the most convenient for both Buyer and Seller. My personal preference, though, is plain old checks and Money Orders. That may seem a little old fashioned, but online payment services are actually quite costly. Did you know that in most cases the Seller winds up paying PayPal and Billpoint more than the amount paid to eBay in Final Value Fees? Believe me, that's a fact. Online payment services are very convenient but they do drive up the costs for Sellers, so eventually this winds up costing all of us a little bit more. Please feel free to contact me directly via email at LindaGHTX@aol.com I Guarantee Total Satisfaction -- if you are unhappy with your purchase for any reason just return the item and I will refund all you've paid plus reimburse you for return shipping.

Definitely! In a society where \"Cool Rules,\" REAL is the deal!! Bid now and let's get back to basics. NO Reserve, Low Opening Bid, Actual Priority Mail Shipping in the U.S., Actual AirMail to Europe and Canada. Usually NO RESERVE (unless otherwise noted), low opening bid, and Low Priced, Fast shipping. A quick word to our long time friends and customers as well as new: Other eBay dealers sell hose and other items, but not too many take the time to give you a good description and, perhaps, a little history, tips, etc...... We thank all of you who have taken the time to view, bid on and win our auctions! As always, we're happy to answer your questions about hosiery or any of our items. You can pay for this auction with: Money Order, Personal Check (will send you the item when it clears), With Your Visa Or MasterCard in the U.S. You Can Use PayPal. PayPal is now available around the world. Click on the PayPal logo below or visit them at: http://www.paypal.com, or, If You're An International Bidder, You Can Use Bid Pay To Send A Western Union Money Order In U.S. DOLLARS! They are at http://www.bidpay.com And now a quick word about our rules of the road. Please Take 2 Minutes To Read This And Avoid Delays Or Misunderstandings: 1.) Please Pay For Your Item Within 5 Days. If You're Having An Emergency Or A Problem, Let Us Know, We'll Work With You. Items not paid for in the specified time may be withheld from the non-paying bidder and may relisted. 2.) Non-paying Bidders Will Receive A Non-Paying Bidders Notice To eBay And Face Negative Feedback, And Ultimately Termination Of Their eBay Account If They Make A Habit Of Not Paying For Auctions. 3.) All Sales Final Unless Otherwise Marked So Please Ask Any Questions Before You Bid. 4.) If You Win More Than One Item Within 24 Hours, Please Be Sure To Let Us Know, So You Can Enjoy Combined Shipping And Save Money 5.) Please Include A Copy Of The Notification Letter With Your Payment For Fastest Service, Whether You Pay By PayPal Or Snail Mail. If You Don't Please Be Sure To Include The eBay Auction Number For Each Item, As Well As A Small Description Of Your Item(s) For The Fastest Service! 6.) Unlike A Majority Of Dealers On eBay We Leave You Feedback A.S.A.P. After Receiving Your Payment. We Would Appreciate Positive Feedback From You If You're Happy With Your Item When You Receive It. 7.) All Money Order or Check Payments MUST be drawn on a U.S. Bank, in U.S. Dollars. For example: A Money Order From The Royal Canadian Bank in U.S. Dollars is NOT accepted, not because we don't like Canadians, but because our bank imposes a hefty fee for such money orders. Canadian and European customers are encouraged to use PayPal or Bid Pay for payments. 8.) If you pay with PayPal and you have won multiple items, PLEASE make only 1 PayPal Payment and include all the auction numbers on the one payment. It simplifies it for you and for me. Also, PayPal charges a transaction fee for EACH payment made, in addition to their OTHER fees to the seller. We combine shipping to save you money - please combine multiple auction PayPal payments into ONE to help keep our costs low, so we can KEEP providing Lower Cost combined shipping.... A quick check of our feedback will show you that nearly every other buyer buys from us more than once!! Also, a larger percentage of our feedback centers on our FAST SHIPPING!!! Are you tired of paying for an item and waiting for 2 weeks? Not with Kathy's Nostalgiabilia. We get your money on Monday, and your item goes out by Wednesday or sooner if possible!! Our shipping rates are still among the best on eBay, even with the recent rise in rates in the Post Office. For up to 4 pairs of stockings: In the U.S $2.50; Canada: $2.75; Europe: $3.75. If you win other than hosiery items, Please See Listing For Actual Shipping Rate, or buyer is responsible for reasonable shipping rate. Believe me, ours are among the best shipping rates on eBay!! Our feedback profile is proof we deliver, however, we are not responsible for loss of goods in the mail that are not insured. Insurance is extra and based on total. Insured items go out once a week: Monday. Non-insured items go out a.s.a.p. upon receipt of payment. Kathy's Nostalgia Guarantees Every Item To Be As Described Or Your Money Back!

Buyer pays $1.95 for First Class shipping and handling to any destination in the USA and I will always combine multiple wins to get the best possible shipping rate. Insured shipping is optional but reasonable (starts at under a dollar and goes up depending on the value of the item, fragility of the item, etc.) I accept just about any kind of payment: All major credit cards are accepted directly and without fees: Visa, MasterCard, Discover and American Express. I also accept Money Orders, Personal Checks, Business Checks, Cashier Checks and even straight Wampum. And of course, I honor basically all the payment services: Billpoint, PayPal, BidPay and PayDirect, with PayPal being perhaps the most convenient for both Buyer and Seller. My personal preference, though, is plain old checks and Money Orders. That may seem a little old fashioned, but online payment services are actually quite costly. Did you know that in most cases the Seller winds up paying PayPal and Billpoint more than the amount paid to eBay in Final Value Fees? Believe me, that's a fact. Online payment services are very convenient but they do drive up the costs for Sellers, so eventually this winds up costing all of us a little bit more.

Plate number 4944A is the fourth of this series. This sculpture plate captures a 3-D image of merry little angles singing \u0026 playing musical instruments in this special Christmas collection. Not only is each plate in lifelike three-dimension, but each contains a music box that plays the beloved Christmas carol featured at the turn of a key. The detail is superb, and each plate has bright cheerful holiday colors. The texture and proportions of each object are perfectly captured from the original sculpture. This 5 plate series of charming hand-crafted art recalls the joys of Christmas. The plate is approximately 6 inches in diameter, is in mint condition, has never been displayed, and comes in the original packaging with certificate of authenticity. Each plate has a clasp on the back of the plate so that it can be hung on the wall and a small built in base so it can stand upright on its own. The plates originally sold for $44 directly from Bradford Exchange. This plate will make a great Christmas gift. I HAVE ALL FIVE PLATES FROM THIS SERIES AND WILL LIST THEM ALL. Winning bid can pay by BillPoint, PayPal, money order, or check. Please allow 5 days for personal checks to clear before I ship the item. PLEASE SUBMIT PAYMENT WITHIN 10 DAYS AFTER AUCTION HAS CLOSED. I pack the items carefully; however, I cannot be held responsible for lost or broken items. Buyer can purchase insurance for an extra $1.10 to $3.00 depending on the value of the shipment. Shipping is by Priority Mail. The plates are easily twice to three times the weight of a typical Bradford Exchange plate so shipping 1 plate is $6.45; 2 plates are $8.35 and 3 plates are $10.00. I try to give an accurate description of the condition so you know what you are purchasing. Please feel free to E-mail me prior to bidding if you have any questions. Will do my best to get the plates out as fast as possible, but shipping during the holidays can be slow. Thank you for looking.

In his quest to create a vampire film to die for, F.W. Murnau (Malkovich) hires the mysterious Max Schreck (Dafoe) to play Count Orlock in his masterpiece Nosferatu. Murnau introduces Schreck as \"the ultimate method actor\" -- one who will appear only in character, in full makeup and only at night.

Meet Elliot Richards, a well-meaning but socially inept technical-support advisor who is in love with Alison Gardner, a female co-worker. Unfortunately she barely knows he's alive. Desperate to gain Alison's affections, Elliot strikes a deal with the Devil - a lusty, drop-dead gorgeous woman with, as he'll soon discover, a wicked sense of humor. In exchange for Elliot's soul, the temptress will grant him seven wishes. To start, Elliot asks to be rich, powerful and married to Alison. When he awakens the next morning, he discovers he's all that and more - as a Colombian drug lord. No problem, he thinks, because he's got six more wishes. How about becoming the most emotionally sensitive man in the world? Sure, only Elliot ends up a sniveling, driveling fool. A 7' 6\" basketball superstar? Elliot breaks all NBA records, but unfortunately his \"equipment\" doesn't measure up. Elliot is learning the hard way to be careful what he wishes for. Because the Devil, always a step ahead of him, is dishing up hilariously subversive versions of Elliot's desires, turning each of his new lives into a living hell. BEDAZZLED stars BRENDAN FRASER as Elliot Richards, a hapless young man consumed by unrequited love and desperate to change his life. ELIZABETH HURLEY plays the Devil, who slyly promises to do just that - for a price. FRANCES O'CONNOR plays Alison Gardner, the object of Elliot's affections. 6660024 This outfit is worn by Brendan as the drug lord when he desires to be \"rich\". Click here to view all FOX Auctions.

The James DeMonaco/Kevin Fox screenplay follows an accused man who is forced to commit crimes in order to prove himself innocent of murder. After Chicago police hostage negotiator Danny Roman (Samuel L. Jackson ) succeeds in rescuing a little girl menaced by her gun-wielding dad, he's praised by both the police department and the media, and he returns to his usual cop routines with his longtime partner, promising his new wife Karen (Regina Taylor ) he'll make it home for dinner every night. Then his partner, who had evidence of embezzlement within the police department, is killed. Since Danny arrives at the crime scene only seconds later, he's the main suspect, and Chief Al Travis (John Spencer ) asks him to turn in his gun and badge. Danny invades the Chicago Internal Affairs Division headquarters and tries to get the truth from Inspector Terence Niebaum (J.T. Walsh) while holding two assistants and Commander Frost (Ron Rifkin) as hostages. He then calls for an outsider from another precinct, hostage negotiator Chris Sabian (Kevin Spacey ). When Sabian arrives, the two compete for control, while Danny attempts to prove to him that he's been falsely accused. The film is dedicated to J.T. Walsh, who died not long after the production wrapped. ~ Bhob Stewart, All Movie Guide I love Harry Potter Matrix Star Trek cell hobbit lord of the rings star wars","_ItemID":"1497508464"},{"_id":{"$oid":"5d8c0dc5f4982fe52d169412"},"Name":"ESTELLE GETTY autographed 8x10","Category":["Movies \u0026 Television","Memorabilia","Autographs","Movies"],"Currently":"$5.00","First_Bid":"$5.00","Number_of_Bids":"0","Location":{"_Latitude":"41.767929","_Longitude":"-72.06127","__text":"hampton, ct"},"Country":"USA","Started":"Dec-16-01 15:14:09","Ends":"Dec-23-20 15:14:09","Seller":{"_Rating":"2803","_UserID":"pnpautographs"},"Description":"Beautifully autographed 8x10 picture.

Jack Willis, truck driver, who has just become a top selling romantic novelist. To avoid embarrassment (being a man's man!) he needs a name, a woman's name, and he chooses that of his best friend, Ruby Vale.

Like two fish out of water and out of their depths, Jack and Ruby are drawn closer together as they cope with all the media attention and the big city life.

SYNOPSIS: In this science fiction thriller, child psychiatrist Catherine Deane (Jennifer Lopez) has developed a technique that allows her to travel through the minds of her patients. When Stargher (Vincent D'Onofrio ), a multiple murder who methodically drowns his victims and performs bizarre rituals with their bodies, falls into a coma, FBI agent Peter Novak (Vince Vaughn) asks Deane to enter the killer's psyche, in the hope of finding a missing girl whom Stargher has kidnapped; if she's not soon found, in all likelihood she'll die in his torture cell. However, once Deane enters the bizarre world of Stargher's mind, she finds getting out to be a very difficult matter. The Cell was the first feature from director Tarsem, who previously made award-winning commercials and music videos, including the video for R.E.M.'s \"Losing My Religion.\" The supporting cast includes Catherine Sutherland, Marianne Jean-Baptiste, Dylan Baker, and Pruitt Taylor Vance. ~ Mark Deming, All Movie Guide I love Harry Potter Matrix Star Trek cell hobbit lord of the rings star wars","_ItemID":"1497521179"},{"_id":{"$oid":"5d8c0dc5f4982fe52d16942d"},"Name":"SILK STALKINGS TV ROB ESTES PUBLICITY SLIDES","Category":["Movies \u0026 Television","Memorabilia","Television","Other"],"Currently":"$7.99","First_Bid":"$7.99","Number_of_Bids":"0","Location":"WE ACCEPT PAYPAL","Country":"USA","Started":"Dec-16-01 15:55:31","Ends":"Dec-23-20 15:55:31","Seller":{"_Rating":"583","_UserID":"starpix5"},"Description":"3 ORIGINAL 35mm COLOR PUBLICITY SLIDES FROM THE SILK STALKINGS TV SERIES WITH ROB ESTES \u0026 MITZI KAPTURE.

Posters from the WPA [Work Projects Administration, originally known as Works Progress Administration] were originally produced from 1936 to 1943 as part of Franklin Delano Roosevelt's New Deal program to put Americans back to work. The objective of the posters were to promote and publicize many programs from 17 different states and the District of Columbia including: education, community activities, culture, health and safety, travel and tourism, and World War II. Federal Project Number One was established within the WPA as central administration for arts related projects. This was one of the first government programs to support the arts and allowed funding for the Federal Arts Project (FAP) which employeed thousands of artists. Many of these artists worked on WPA poster divisions throughout the US. The diverse poster divisions and the interactions on the many artists associated with them helped to create what is now known as the American poster style. LEARN MORE DETAIL ABOUT THE WPA PROGRAM.

Stars: Bette Davis, Donald Crisp, Fay Bainter, George Brent, Georgia Caine, Gordon Oliver, Henry Fonda, Henry O'Neill, Irving Pichel, Jack Norton, Janet Shaw, John Litel, Margaret Lindsay, Richard Cromwell, Spring Byington. Set in the antebellum South, William Wyler_s JEZEBEL centers on high society beauty Julie Marsden. Julie first arrives on horseback, then enters her home flamboyantly hooking the long flowing train of her dress with her riding crop and hoisting it to her shoulders. Julie is not just high-spirited--she is self-centered and high-handed, and she gets away with outrageous behavior because she is rich and beautiful. However, she gets her comeuppance--losing Pres and becoming reclusive and spiteful--before a chance for redemption occurs. JEZEBEL is built around Bette Davis_s bold, powerful, and, at times, subtle performance; when Julie discovers Pres and Amy are married, with the smallest of movements Davis conveys disbelief, then anguish as she realizes the truth--she looks down, her eyelids flicker, she glances from Pres to Amy and back, and utters single words while struggling to maintain her composure. And Fay Bainter, as Aunt Belle, matches Davis when she too discovers Pres is married and continues to greet her guests while worrying about her niece and how she can warn her. Both actresses won well-deserved Oscars. JEZEBEL is also distinguished by Wyler_s and cinematographer Ernest Haller_s graceful, flowing long takes and deep-frame compositions.

Every year the Krewe of Bacchus has a celebrity guest. The coins are always the color of wine as Bacchus is the God of Wine I believe. They don't scan well but are very nice when you see them. I have a number of different celebrities on these coins. You may want to try to collect all of them. Only .75 cents to ship in the U.S. I have a number of related items up for sale on eBay. If you would like to see them click here. Bob Hope (Leslie Townes Hope) actor, comedian Born: 5/29/03 Birthplace: Eltham, England American film, radio and television comedian known for his topical jokes, quick delivery and long career in show business. He appeared in several Road films with comedy partner Bing Crosby and Dorothy Lamour. His films include Road to Utopia (1940) and The Paleface (1947). Since 1940, Hope has tirelessly entertained U.S. troops stationed overseas. For those of you who don t know, Mardi Gras doubloons are brightly colored aluminum coins about the size of a silver dollar. They are thrown by Krewe members from Mardi Gras floats. Doubloons usually have the symbol of the Krewe on the front along with the date the Krewe was organized, the back side usually has the theme for that years parade as well as the date. Each Krewe may have a number of different doubloons for each years parade. Usually the silver ones are the most common, followed by a range of colors from red to gold. Some Krewes mint real bronze, silver and even gold doubloons, however these are very rare and seldom put up for sale. Many Mardi Gras doubloons are fairly rare outside of New Orleans, and many are rare even in the city. They make great inexpensive yet unique collectibles or gifts. I am in the process of auctioning a number of doubloons from my collection. The subject matter of my individual doubloon auctions vary a great deal. I have coins for a lot of different themes. If you would like to see my other coins please CLICK HERE.. Shipping is only $.75 cents in the United States. Buy a number of coins and save on shipping. Thank you for looking at my auction, and have a nice day. NO RESERVE! Shipping for one doubloon is .75 cents.

Rating: R This is what the box says about this film: It began on a quiet Sunday in Gatlin, Nebraska. That was the day the children slaughtered all the grownups. Isaac, the boy preacher, told them that He Who Walks Behind the Rows was pleased, and three years later the children still follow Isaac and his evil teenage disciple, Malachai. When a young couple traveling cross-country accidentally drive into Gatlin, they begin to discover the town's terrible secrets. However, what they don't realize is that they have become part of the children's bloody mission; a mission that cannot be fulfilled until the two intruders are dead.

This is a film full of atmosphere - wonderful cinematography, beautiful locations, a stunning soundtrack and some fantastic performances. Don't look at this film and think this is a war film, it isn't, this is film about East meets West, Clashes of tradition, culture and beliefs.

If such a thing as mood music exists then this is mood film - switch the lights off, turn the sound up and be absorbed. Visually stunning, fantastic soundtrack, outstanding performances all around.

MINT!!! 5 Oscar Nominations!! Stars Johnny Depp, Juliette Binoche, Judi Dench, Alfred Molina and Lena Olin. Edition Details: _ Region 1 encoding (US and Canada only) _ Color, Closed-captioned, Widescreen, Dolby _ Commentary by director Lasse Hallstrom and the producers _ Production Design Featurette _ Making Of Chocolat _ Deleted Scenes _ A feature on the film's costumes _ Widescreen anamorphic format With movies like Chocolat, it's always best to relax and absorb the abundant sensual pleasures, be it the heart-stopping smile of chocolatier Juliette Binoche as she greets a new customer, an intoxicating cup of spiced hot cocoa, or the soothing guitar of an Irish gypsy played by Johnny Depp. Adapted by Robert Nelson Jacobs from Joanne Harris's popular novel and lovingly directed by Lasse Hallstr_m, the film covers familiar territory and deals in broad metaphors that even a child could comprehend, so it's no surprise that some critics panned it with killjoy fervor. Their objections miss the point. Familiarity can be comforting and so can easy metaphors when placed in a fable that's as warmly inviting as this one. Driven by fate, Vianne (Binoche) drifts into a tranquil French village with her daughter Anouk (Victoire Thivisol, from Ponette) in the winter of 1959. Her newly opened chocolatier is a source of attraction and fear, since Vianne's ability to revive the villagers' passions threatens to disrupt their repressive traditions. The pious mayor (Alfred Molina) sees Vianne as the enemy, and his war against her peaks with the arrival of \"river rats\" led by Roux (Depp), whose attraction to Vianne is immediate and reciprocal. Splendid subplots involve a battered wife (Lena Olin), a village elder (Judi Dench), and her estranged daughter (Carrie-Anne Moss), and while the film's broader strokes may be regrettable (if not for Molina's rich performance, the mayor would be a caricature), its subtleties are often sublime. Chocolat reminds you of life's simple pleasures and invites you to enjoy them.

SMITH \u0026 MR. JONES DVD NEW Description In the 1950s a super-secret government agency was formed to monitor and police the activities of extraterrestrial aliens on the planet Earth. Some 40 years later a founding father of the agency, Agent Kay (Tommy Lee Jones), finds himself with a new smart-mouthed partner fresh from the NYPD who is soon dubbed Agent Jay (Will Smith). Their first mission is to save the Earth from destruction by a giant insectlike alien (Vincent D_Onfrio) that, incidentally, drives an exterminator_s truck. Armed with their matching Ray-Bans, skinny ties, and space-age weapons that Jay barely understands--he calls the Neuralyzer the \"flashy thing\"--the new duo begin another average day of fighting intergalactic terrorists. An amazingly hip and terribly clever movie that riffs on everything from E.T.--THE EXTRA-TERRESTRIAL to CASABLANCA, this Barry Sonnenfeld film is based on the equally savvy comic book by Lowell Cunningham.

About racial tension at a California college, the characters are hopelessly stereotyped and grouped according to race, with the black guys being cool, the white guys being racists and rapists or, at the very least, slobs, and the women being prizes to be earned, even if the heroes win the sensitive, smart ones. Singleton made a name for himself coming out of college with a film script that landed him his first director's job, but it is hard to believe, watching the film, that he ever visited a campus. He turns the stimulating diversity of a university student body into a clich_d Balkanization of race and depicts professors ejecting students from classes for not paying their tuition on time. Many scenes in the 126 minute movie also go on for too long, and there is one very young actor playing a white racist who seems to be trying to imitate Marlon Brando in Roots II . That said, however, the film has a number of strikingly designed sequences, and in its exploration of racial and economic polarities it takes the time to present intelligent arguments--honest-to-goodness messages--about the necessity of working to the best of one's capabilities and not giving up in the face of despair. There is one especially memorable romantic sequence, an intercutting of two scenes, where one of the heroines is seen embracing a male lover in some shots and a female lover in others, edited in such a way that the gender of the woman's partner becomes irrelevant to the eroticism. Laurence Fishburne is also on hand as a political science teacher, and he handles what could be a very embarrassing role with great finesse, delivering Singleton's morals without batting an eyelash. Singleton depicts college as a place where the abstract intellectualism of learning grinds against life's realities, searching for an even sprocket. He manages to find a few, not enough to prevent the movie from failing, but enough to make the failure worthwhile. The picture is letterboxed with an aspect ratio of about 1.85:1 and the framing looks accurate. The color transfer is fine. Fleshtones are a little soft at times, but the image is solid and darker scenes are stable. The stereo surround sound is good, and the music soundtrack is appropriately boisterous. The program is effectively closed captioned. The film is spread to three sides in CLV and is accompanied by a promising theatrical trailer A film by John Singleton.

Gorgeous 8 X 10 color glossy photo of actress BARBARA EDEN. An Arizona native, actress Barbara Eden was three years old when her family moved to San Francisco, where as a teenager she plunged into acting and singing classes at San Francisco State College's Conservatory of Music. After briefly working as a band singer, Eden took up residence at Hollywood's Studio Club, an inexpensive rooming house for aspiring actresses. Other Studio Club residents would note in later years that Eden would look at the club's bulletin board and apply for every show business job available, even those that she was advised would \"ruin\" her career. Persistence paid off, and in 1956 Eden made her film debut in Back from Eternity. She worked steadily in television, finally attaining leading-lady status on the 1958 sitcom How to Marry a Millionaire, in which she played a myopic \"Marilyn Monroe\"-type golddigger. Good film and TV roles followed for the lovely blonde actress, and full stardom arrived with the NBC comedy series I Dream of Jeannie. Eden played the curvaceous bottle imp from 1965-70, reviving the character in a brace of TV movies, the last one produced in 1991. Eden's post-Jeannie career has included several films, TV guest star appearances, theatrical and nightclub engagements, and still another sitcom, 1981's Harper Valley P.T.A. _ Hal Erickson PLEASE READ: I do not utilize at this time the optional \"checking out\" feature displayed on my item description page by EBAY.

Slouchy waist and full, flowing legs. 33\" inseam. Belt NOT included.(B149P59E) ** Catalog Price: $98 Size: 16 Color: Khaki as Shown Flaws: None. Ho, Ho, HO, Merry Christmas!! We would like to show our Christmas spirit as well as our gratitude to all of our wonderful Ebay customers for the holidays. Our Christmas special allows all Ebayers to purchase one item at their winning bid amount (plus $5.50 for shipping \u0026 handling) and get a second item (of equal or lesser value) for 50% off your winning bid amount PLUS we will waive the additional item shipping charge! This is good for all auctions that are marked \"Christmas Special\". You can only use this special with one transaction at a time. Example: If you purchase 4 items and wish to have them all shipped together you can only use the special for 2 items and will be charged the winning bid amount plus $1 s\u0026h for the additional two items. Or, you can use the special for the 4 items separately. You can use the special on the first two items and pay $5.50 for s\u0026h, and then use the special for the second two items and pay $5.50 for s\u0026h. In some instances this would not work out as well for you as using the combined shipping option. We wish everyone the VERY Merriest Christmas And Happy New Year!! Note: All of our merchandise is customer returns and/or overstock in excellent condition. If there are any flaws such as rips, holes, and tears we will make sure to describe the flaw in the description of the item. Some of the merchandise may need to be washed or cleaned but not necessarily flawed. Some of the tags have been cut by Victoria's Secret but sizes and manufacturer tags still remain in most. We don't accept returns on this item so please email if you have specific questions before bidding. Shipping and handling is $5.50 for your first item and if combined with other items $1 for each additional item. Please be aware that this price is for shipping and handling and is non-negotiable.

At this point, unfortunately, my method of postage will not accommodate APO addresses. In some cases, I will work with International bidders if they are willing to pay actual shipping and a higher handling charge. We need to work that out by email prior to the bid. Have you thought about using eBay for your Christmas gifts? You can stretch your shopping dollars a great deal! Following is my Seller's info that applies to all items. (Please click on View Seller's Other Auctions or search by Seller ID Duckfeed to keep up with my offerings. My auctions end at all different times, including daytime hours.) I will combine items for shipping to save you money. My maximum hold on items while waiting for other auctions to finish is 7 days. Payment is expected within TEN (10) days of close of sale. Please be sure to list item name and item number on Paypal or Billpoint, or with your money order or check. All items are sold \"as is\" with no returns. See my high-volume positive feedback, and you will see that I sell quality merchandise. I accept Billpoint, Paypal, money orders (and checks with hold if you have a lot of positive eBay feedback). Clothing I sell can be described as \"better quality\" clothing of a designer name brand purchased in Nordstroms, Macys, Saks, Niemans, Grodins, Talbots, Casual Corner, Ann Taylor, etc. All items are used, and most items look new. See my other auctions. I don't put anything on auction that I would not wear myself or ask my man-friend to wear. I have a long time corporate background and know what career clothing comprises the \"dress for success\" look. I am human and do my very best to represent items honestly, point out any flaws I find, and leave you feeling great about what you buy. I work very hard to offer consistent positive customer service. If I miss an obvious flaw in my description, I will deal with you with integrity. Colors are sometimes distorted, as it's hard to get all the software to work together with total accuracy. I try to describe colors. YOU MAY NEED TO DRY CLEAN OR LAUNDER THE ITEM, according to its label instructions, although some items will not need it. Because my profit margin is low and because the items usually get pretty wrinkled in transit, I do not invest in dry cleaning most items prior to sale. Just compare what you would pay for the item in a department store, and the dry cleaning cost will seem minimal. :) You will most likely need to press a garment after its journey through the mail. Please do not cancel your bid. We sellers appreciate it if you wait to bid until you are sure. Bidders who frivolously cancel truly jeopardize a seller's income and can scare other bidders away. Read everything carefully, and please stick with the bid if you bid. Be sure to look at the other auctions by Duckfeed. I have a lot of beautiful, quality clothing and vintage collectibles.

First of all, it can be worn fully zipped via the two large front zippers and the fully wraparound waist zipper. Next, for a very sexy look you can unzip the center zipper which will show a 2.5\" stretchy band of somewhat transparent black netting (and we all know what else will show!). You can \"vary\" the look by showing just as much as you want by adjusting how low the zipper goes. As you can see in the pictures, the back of the piece has a large velcro closure flap. I'm not really sure what this does, though. 100% guaranteed authentic, with all hang tags, certificates of authenticity and labels attached. It's hard to assess the value of this piece as it's sold out in the U.S. stores even at full retail. Pieces like this sell for $1200 to $2500 though they seldom stay in stock. Fabric Content: Outside Shell is a cordura blend of nylon, polyester and polyurethane with the feel of soft canvas. The lining is poly blend plush short pile fleece. The piece is trimmed in genuine leather. Where Made: Italy Chest Measurement: 36_ Waist Measurement: 34_ Length: 21_ Neck Style: Black Fabric Trimmed Labeling: Intact and Uncut Item Pictures Back Top Closeup Closeup of the top of the front when unzipped All zippers carry the impressed \"PRADA MILANO\" Mark Huge Label inside the Garment Tag Attached to Authenticity Card Label on the Back of the Vest Detail of Bottom Back of Vest Measurements Please note that many of the items are hard to measure due to their stretchy or otherwise _tough_ fabrics.

Presenting a fabulous suit w/pleated slacks from HSM. This is a newer issue with their \"softly tailored\" line of wools. The size is marked 54 long. Be sure and check the specific measurements below for all the details on fit. The fabric is soft and luxurious. The weight works year around. The color is solid gray. The jacket is a 2 button single breasted style, fully lined with a single vent. The slacks are double pleated, cuffed and lined to below the knees. The condition is . superb. The only flaw I could find on the suit is a tiny pin prick hole on the left sleeve near the shoulder (see the last photo). To me, this is a total non-issue. I seriously doubt anyone will even notice this because it's so small. Other than that, the suit is perfect. Here are the specific measurements: JACKET Sleeve (from shoulder hem to end of sleeve) 26\" w/1 1/2\" that could be let out. Shoulder (from shoulder hem to shoulder hem) 22\" Length (from bottom of collar in back to bottom hem) 32\" Chest (from side to side underneath arms while coat is laying down, then doubled) 58\" PANTS Waist 50 1/2\" w/3\" that could be let out. Inseam (inside seam from crotch to cuff) 30\" w/2 1/2\" that could be let out to keep the cuff. Outseam (outside seam from top of beltline to cuff) 43 1/2\" Some of my auctions may end during the day. Please be aware of this and bid early if you won't have access to the internet during the day. PLEASE READ ALL OF THE FOLLOWING BEFORE BIDDING: I use USPS Priority mail for shipping. For packages under 2 lbs, the cost is $3.95. 2-3 lbs. is $5.20, 3-4 is $6.45, 4-5 is $7.70.

The fabric is a brilliant green satin- which catches every bit of light- and a black velvet bodice. This fabric really gleams with iridescent reflection! I don't think the photos really capture this. The cut of the bodice provides a very flattering fit. The skirt angles higher towards the left leg. This style creates an attractive, elegant walk. A layer of crinoline enhances the skirt from beneath. The neckline is off the shoulder with a coordinating bow on the left. The dress is labeled a size 3, and it will easily fit a petite 1/2 or a girl size 14/16 without need for any adjustments. No guesswork involved; measurements are for a 32-34 bust, 27-30 waist, and a height of 5'0\"-5'5\". It is possible this dress will fit a ladie's typical label size 4. However, a girl of that size, who once borrowed the dress, commented it was a tight fit for most of her evening. This dress is in excellent, like new condition with no rips or stains! The price is great, too! This dress is perfect for Winter Formal dances and a great holiday dress for New Year's Eve parties. Email your questions. I accept Paypal, BidPay, Billpoint, money order, or personal check. Checks must clear before dress is shipped. Shipping is fixed at $5.50. Happy bidding!

This printer powers up, runs through its diagnostics, and says that it is ready to print, but I haven't been able to test printing with it because I don't have the drivers for it. The printer is in good condition cosmetically and includes a removable paper tray. There is some sticky residue left from when labels were removed from the casing, and there are a few labels still left on it, but the casing has no cracks or signs of damage. I have another one of these printers in identical condition, so if the winning bidder wants to buy two of them, I'll list the second one in a Buy It Now auction for the same amount as the winning bid. Good luck, and thanks for looking! READ THIS INFORMATION BEFORE BIDDING Terms and Conditions: I will email the winning bidder shortly after close-of-auction (typically less than 24 hours.) The winning bidder should reply with their full address and phone number (you don't have to give me this, but if you don't I'll put my number on your shipping label.) I ship FedEx Ground for most items and can provide you with a shipping quote if you email me your zip code. Please request your quote before the day your auction ends. I charge exact shipping charges and exact packaging charges-- I will also quote these to you. If we receive payment by Saturday at noon, your package will go out to FedEx on the weekend and ship out on Monday morning. If we receive your payment by Tuesday at noon, your package will go out Wednesday night and ship Thursday morning. We stick to this schedule because we both work regular jobs and have to maintain some kind of normalcy in our schedules. Please inspect your package as soon as it arrives and keep ALL packaging. If the shipper causes damage in transit, you will have to present your packaging as proof when you make your claim. I do not give refunds or exchanges on things damaged in shipping-- you'll have to file a claim with the shipper. I will provide whatever supporting information I can in order to help. I guarantee that things are as-advertised, so if there is an issue, please email me and I'll do my best to fix the problem. Please contact me first if you feel that my service is so poor that I deserve negative or neutral feedback. Sometimes email fails and I'll miss a message, but I always strive to make my customers happy. Let me know if there are problems and I'll try to fix them. One last thing-- do NOT ask me to ship things that aren't media by the USPS media rate. I won't lie and break a federal law to save you ten bucks. I'm here to run a clean business and enjoy the eBay community. Let's keep it friendly and professional.

Small Wonder: At just over one inch high, the N650U scanner is one of the thinnest flatbed scanners in the world. It's also one of the easiest to set up and use. Connect with just a single USB cable to any compatible Mac_ or PC-no power cord or bulky transformers are necessary. Just plug it in to your computer and scan photos, graphics, copy and more at a remarkable 600 x 1200 dpi for crisp, clear images. Plus, 42-bit resolution gives you over four trillion possible colors for richer, more robust scans. It even has an external programmable button for fast, one-touch scanning. Scanning bulky items is easier then ever: Canon's exclusive Z-Lid Expansion Top will change the way you scan bulky items, such as books and magazines. Many other scanner covers lift only at an angle and become uneven and awkward when scanning anything that isn't completely flat.

The flamingos are not marked, but were actually standing in water in the dish when we purchased them, and because of the identical style, I have no doubt this is a set. The bowl measures 8 1/2 wide by 11 long and 2 1/2\" high. The exterior is light pink on the bottom and deep pink coloring as you reach the edge. The interior is gray with black as you reach the edge, and the very oval in the center bottom is pink. The flamingo which has its head down measures 7 1/4\" tall, and the standing bird measures 10\" tall. They have a high gloss finish, and are done in deep pink with black highlights, and have green leafy bases. The detail is excellent and the quality of the painting is suburb. The flamingos are in excellent condition, no chips, no cracks, no crazing, and no scuffing. The dish has a large chip on the left and a minor one on the right corner edge, and it has crazing. We include a shipping price for all three items, but if you choose to take only the flamingos, it will be less. Over the years I've had a number of these flamingos, but never complete with the dish! It's a beautiful set. Condition, Payment and Shipping Info: Condition of Item: If item is NOT as described, we offer full refund, less shipping, if RETURNED WITHIN 5 DAYS. Postage Costs: USA buyers include $4.50 for box, packing, plus shipping. We carefully pack and box all items, however we suggest Insurance: Uninsured shipments are at the risk of the buyer. We ship WORLDWIDE, but shipping to Canada and overseas is more! Multiple purchases shipped together to save postage. Your Payment: Your payment to be received WITHIN 10 DAYS of auction end.

NEW NEW NEW!!! NEVER BEEN OPENED! This is a Brand New sealed original black bottom disc. The game is really fun. A must-have for collectors of Hello Kitty and puzzle game fanatics alike. The following is a review from Mark Kanarick writer for the All Game Guide Hello Kitty makes her way on to the PlayStation with Hello Kitty's Cube Frenzy. The adorable kitty, whose popularity among little girls came in the form of plush toys, pencils, backpacks and other merchandise. Are you ready to help her solve puzzles in her first PlayStation title? As Hello Kitty, the popular Japanese character, you move her by making cubes disappear or piling them up in order to get her to collect prizes. After clearing a land, you get to choose where you want to go, changing the story. The story begins when Hello Kitty falls asleep at a beach resort. When she wakes up she finds herself on a strange island surrounded by the smell of flowers. She realizes that her archenemy, Badtz-Maru has played a trick on her and she has been transported to another world. To get back home she has to make it through eleven different lands, each consisting of three stages. There are three modes including: the Story mode; the Extra mode, which appears after you clear all the lands; and the Free Play mode, which allows you to play whatever levels you want either alone, with a partner or against a partner. The game also features a bonus round and cute illustrations of Hello Kitty. Hello Kitty's Cube Frenzy is also available on the Game Boy Color, but this PlayStation version uses one block of memory and has vibration feedback compatibility. MAKES A GREAT GIFT !

T. Fischer (see photo of signature). Born in Dresden, Germany, Mr. Fischer emigrated to the United States in 1904 and immediately began work at the Pickard studio. This piece bears the 13/32\" brown decal used by Pickard China from 1905 to 1910 (see photo of mark). The piece is 7 1/2\" wide from open handle to open handle. It is a very shallow bowl shape, probably intended for mints. The piece is in excellent condition, without any cracks, chips, or restoration. Some of the gold paint decoration is raised to give the piece depth and texture; one of the small, slightly raised gold beads of paint that you see on the black border is partially gone, revealing white glaze beneath. A lovely example of this important artist's work that will grace your Pickard collection. With over 25 years experience selling antiques by mail order and on Ebay, we stand behind our merchandise.

Below, I have outlined a little bit about me and the terms under which I sell my items. Please take a moment to look them over and I hope you enjoy bidding. WHERE DO MY ITEMS COME FROM ? I spend my time searching high and low looking for great deals that I can pass on to the nice people on eBay. The items come from Auctions, Flea Markets, Tag Sales, Going out of Business Liquidations, Second Hand and Pawn Shops. I check all of the items once and twice over before investing my hard earned money into them because these are usually one of a kind and all sales final. On the more expensive and technical items, I always have them checked over by professionals before the listing is made. HOW DO I SHIP, AND WHEN WILL YOU GET IT ? Like you, I buy lots of things on eBay and I know that when I do I want to receive the item as soon as possible, know that it is on its way, and get it in one piece. To this end, I use UPS ground. They may not be as cheap as some others, but they get the job done consistently and allow me to ship almost every day. Also, when I ship items, the recipients get a email that provides them with a tracking # and link to track their item. This tracking system is very accurate and in my opinion is far superior to the one that the Post Office uses. FLAT RATE SHIPPING AND HANDLING FOR THIS ITEM IS $22.30 The price that I am charging for the shipping is Flat Rate for the Continental United States and constitutes all of the costs of shipping and handling the package. That includes, not only the postage fee, but the box, packing media, tape, labels, printer supplies, and labor to pay someone to pack your item with the care that you can expect from me Buyers outside of the continental US must pay one and a half % of the stated shipping price to cover the higher price of shipping to those locations. I will ship to Canada, but be aware that I will not submit documents with false item descriptions or values to save you money on taxes, or be responsible for brokerage fees and delays. HOW DO I ACCEPT PAYMENTS ? I accept Credit Cards through Pay Pal, Money Orders \u0026 Cashiers Checks. I give my buyers up to 7 days to get their payment to me after the auction ends. I reserve the right to resell items not paid for by that time and return late payments CREDIT CARD CUSTOMERS PLEASE NOTE If you are not already a registered PayPal user, please note that PayPal allows credit card transactions up to only $250.00 until your account is verified. After that, you can charge more. The verification process usually takes 2 days. If you are bidding on this item and your bid will total over $250.00 including shipping, you may want to sign up for PayPal now to expedite your order. There is no purchase or obligation necessary WHAT HAPPENS IF THERE IS A PROBLEM WITH THE ITEM THAT YOU BUY I give buyers 7 days to inspect their purchase. In the unlikley event that there is a problem with it, I will either fix the item or refund your money upon the prompt return of the item. New items are sold as new and as I am not a dealer defects must be taken up through the product warranty. View and search all the items in my picture gallery Auctiva PowerTools .

DESCRIPTIONS It is our goal to describe the item in our advertisements to the best of our ability. We use all the qualified sources that are available to us in order to give you the most thorough description. However, we are not infallible and so we recommend that all customers do their own research prior to bidding on any item. NOTEBOOKS, COMPUTER SYSTEMS, INKJETS, LASER PRINTERS Systems, notebooks, hard drives and the like may from time to time have software on them. We are not selling any software whatsoever unless it is clearly advertised in the advertisement and contains the users license and agreement. In the event that you receive a system, notebook or hard drive or any other media that contains any software it is your sole responsibility to either delete, erase or license said software. We are in no way giving you any right to use any software whatsoever. Notebooks contain batteries so that they may function without their power packs. These batteries are considered a consumable that is replaceable by the user. These batteries and any other consumables (printer ribbons, toner cartridges, etc.) on any device we sell are not covered under any warranty. Simply put, notebook batteries are not covered under our warranty even if the advertisement says that the product is guaranteed working. Unless the notebook specifically states that the battery is in working order it will not be covered under warranty. Laser printers and inkjets have the same limitations as above. We do not guarantee the ink supply or the laser toner cartridge even when the item is guaranteed working. These toner cartridges and ink cartridges are considered consumables and must be replaced by the user. PICTURES All auctions where possible contain as many detailed pictures as we have available. These pictures are there to help you decide condition and quality. We attempt to provide as much graphic information as is humanly possible. Please look at the picture carefully in determining what may or may not come with the item. If there is an item that you believe should come with the item being auctioned is not visible in a picture it is more than likely that item is not included. In other words, if the item is not pictured then it is not being sold in the auction. Once again, if there is a question please feel free to email us prior to placing a bid. WARRANTY Unless stated above in the description for the auction all items are sold as is where is with no warranty expressed or implied.
